  description: New managers are often promoted without receiving management training, yet management is not something you just figure out. The experience of being expected to know how to manage, yet not being trained to do so often results in new managers feeling isolated and unsure how to move from making to managing.

Topics covered will include hiring, delegating, creating a team culture, and leading people whose specialized knowledge exceeds your own. The talk take-aways should be applicable to managers and employees at large and small institutions alike.
