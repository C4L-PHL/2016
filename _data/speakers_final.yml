  Name: Julie Swierczek
  Bio: |
    Julie Swierczek corrals files and tries to make them stick around if needed. She believes that the first step of digital preservation is adopting Camus’ position that “One must imagine Sisyphus happy”.  Julie became interested in digital preservation in a previous job where she proposed starting a digital preservation program using only elbow grease, duct tape, and Amazon Web Services.  The proposal was rejected, which only strengthened her resolve to imagine Sisyphus as a cheerful fellow. Julie has worked as a university archivist and special collections librarian and also as a cataloging and metadata librarian. She is enamored with good documentation.

  Name: Daniel Aitken
  Bio: |
    Daniel has been working for discoverygarden since 2013, and was dubbed "QA Dan" early on due to an organizational overload of Dans at that time. Since then, he's gone on to shore up the automated testing and delivery of Islandora components, quality check more pieces of the Islandora framework than he can actually remember, and now works fully on the development side of the project. He keeps the moniker, though, as it would be too much of a hassle to change his twitter handle and GitHub credentials over at this point.
