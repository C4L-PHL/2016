<p>
    New managers are often promoted without receiving management training,
    yet management is not something you just figure out. The experience of
    being expected to know how to manage, yet not being trained to do so
    often results in new managers feeling isolated and unsure how to move
    from making to managing. In this talk Iâ€™ll focus on my own managerial
    experience of designing and leading an archival tech team in a small
    independent archives. Topics covered will include hiring, delegating,
    creating a team culture, and leading people whose specialized knowledge
    exceeds your own. The talk take-aways should be applicable to managers
    and employees at large and small institutions alike.
