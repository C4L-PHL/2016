title: Building a Geocoding Toolset for Libraries
---
<p>Following up on a breakout session at Hydracamp, this session will be a hackathon/skillshare event to start working on a shared geocoding toolset for library data work. Looking at and working with existing tools and datasets, such as Geonames, the Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names, Twofishes.net and Whoâ€™s on First, this session will collaborate on a service that can help reconcile place names and metadata with geospatial entities. Work will focus on building a service that can be used by folks without GIS knowledge, perform better disambiguation and mapping between place name forms of different vocabularies, and be scalable for increasingly large datasets.
