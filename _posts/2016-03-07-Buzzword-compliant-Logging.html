<p>The preconference will cover real and imaginary world use cases on logging. We will have a broad overview on Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana. Using Ansible and Vagrant (Otto?) we will set up a lab to test shipping and customizing logs that will be indexed by Elasticsearch and viewed in Kibana. 

In addition and time permitting the pre-conference will be designed with how to scale your logging infrastructure. 

We require all participants to bring their own laptop during the workshop. In preparation to this workshop we require you have JDK 1.7.x installed. Mac or Linux OS is preferred as you can use native commands to work with the software and may also use the Ubuntu VMs.

We recommend that Windows users have a Linux VM installed RHEL, CentOS or Ubuntu.</p>
