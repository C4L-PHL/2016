title: Catmandu - a (meta)data toolkit
---
<p>Catmandu provides a suite of software modules to ease the import, storage, retrieval, export and transformation of (meta)data records. After a short introduction to Catmandu and its features, we will present the command line interface (CLI) and the domain specific language (DSL). Participants will be guided to get data from different sources via APIs, to transform data records to a common data model, to store/index it in Elasticsearch or MongoDB, to query data from stores and to export it to different formats. The intended audience is Systems librarians, Metadata librarians, and Data managers. Participants should be familiar with command line interfaces (CLI). Programming experience is not required. Required is a Laptop with VirtualBox installed. Organisers will provide a VirtualBox image (Linux guest system) beforehand. Participants can also install their own environment, see here. Participants could bring their own data (CSV, JSON, MARC, MAB2, PICA+, XLS, YAML).</p>
