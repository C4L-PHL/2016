title: Code4Arc
---
<p>Building off of last yearâ€™s first Code4Arc event, this pre-conference is an opportunity for the archivists and developers who work with them to talk about archives specific tools, workflows and development, with an emphasis on open-source software. We wish to create a space to talk about how coding for archives may be different than coding for libraries and interaction with cross-domain tools such as repositories, discovery and access systems.

Code4Arc is a participatory event and the agenda will be made available in advance for participants to sign up for lightening talks, demonstrations or case studies. We will also have break-out sessions to discuss topics of interest to the participants, for example, workflows, tool integrations, handoffs and metadata conventions.  Short community project updates will be available from BitCurator Access, Educopia, Archivematica, ArchivesSpace, AtoM and Islandora.</p>
