<p>Come and learn how the command line is the best friend you've always wanted. This workshop will focus on beginner to intermediate uses of the command line to perform tasks like processing data, organizing folders and files, downloading web content, and running scripts. We will use the UNIX command line, which can be used on Mac OS X and Linux out of the box and with a little setup on Windows computers as well. The preconference session will be a mixture of lecture, examples, and hands-on learning exercises.
Are you an experienced command line user who wants to attend? Please do! You can assist others will their exercises, share your expertise, and perhaps even learn a new trick or two.</p>
