title: Digitization Project Starter&#58; What you need to know to plan that OCR project.
---
<p>Open source tools for preparing and completing an OCR project abound. Nevertheless, planning such a project in the library can still be daunting. It doesn't have to be that way. We'll spend half a day looking at the tools, resources, and workflow necessary for such a project: From creating digital page images, to generating groundtruth, to running OCR, to post-OCR correction. Come with your head in the clouds and leave with your feet on the ground, ready to start running.
In a nutshell: If you're thinking of starting an OCR project, I'll tell you what you need to think about, and where to start finding answers.</p>
