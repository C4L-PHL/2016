<p>An advanced course for people who have attended Dive into Hydra or who already have experience with Ruby and Fedora 4. 

We go beyond data modeling and explore the advanced features of the Hydra project including out of the box solutions such as Sufia, Avalon and Curation Concerns.  We'll learn about the Portland Common Data Model (PCDM) and learn the "Hydra way" to do file characterization, derivative generation, and streaming media.</p>
