<p>Discovery systems offer the current best hope of a single search across disparate library sources and seamless delivery of content. Using the EBSCO Discovery Service (EDS) API, the workshop will look at ways of creating a quality discovery experience for users.  The API provides not only a search endpoint for your libraries entire collection, but a number of other killer features that really shape the user experience as well: the Research Starters API for finding topic overviews and the Publications Finder API for finding journal titles and links to full-text, to name a few.  

With recent infrastructure improvements to increase speed and stability, come get a jumpstart on using the EDS API for your own projects. 
This workshop will cover, amongst other things:

• Integrating discovery within VuFind / Blacklight – how to install and active the discovery API
• Integrating reading lists within the learning management system – how to use and activate discovery within the LMS such as Moodle
• A primer in authenticating and issuing RESTful calls to the API, including best practices and using our action-oriented, state-aware syntax
•Together we'll build a simple application that matches today's current topics (acquired using the New York Times API) with various library materials using the API
