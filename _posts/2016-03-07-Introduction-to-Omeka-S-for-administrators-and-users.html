title: Introduction to Omeka S for administrators and users
---
<p>The newest product in the Omeka family from Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media, Omeka S (https://github.com/omeka/omeka-s/wiki), is available for early adopters to kick the tires and begin ramping up for stable release. Omeka S does not represent a new version of the Omeka 2 series. Instead, it is a complete reworking with particular emphasis on 1) multisite deployment for medium- and large-sized institutions and 2) interoperability with other systems, such as Fedora, DSpace, and Linked Open Data generally.

This workshop will introduce Omeka S for end users. It will clarify the distinction between the Omeka 2.x series and Omeka S for users familiar with Omeka, and will cover the essential concepts of building and managing sites. In particular we will look at creating items, attaching media to them, using item sets, and creating sites. It will also address how to use Omeka S to integrate with other systems, such as Fedora 4, YouTube, IIIF content, and more. The first half of the workshop will discuss and demonstrate the workflows involved, and the second half will be hands-on for participants to build their own sites. This workshop is primarily intended for those who want to understand the new features in Omeka S, but do not expect to be working in the codebase.</p>
