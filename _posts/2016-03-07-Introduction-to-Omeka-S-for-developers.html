title: Introduction to Omeka S for developers
---
<p>
The newest product in the Omeka family from Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media, Omeka S (https://github.com/omeka/omeka-s/wiki), is available for early adopters to kick the tires and begin ramping up for stable release. Omeka S does not represent a new version of the Omeka 2 series. Instead, it is a complete reworking with particular emphasis on 1) multisite deployment for medium- and large-sized institutions and 2) interoperability with other systems, such as Fedora, DSpace, and Linked Open Data generally.

This workshop will introduce the Omeka S codebase for developers, with particular emphasis on creating modules to extend its functionality and on using its API. We will cover how to understand and navigate the codebase, the libraries we leverage (especially Zend Framework 2 and Doctrine), and the data models. The first half will be a discussion and overview, and the second half will be hands on walking through building an example module. This workshop is intended for developers with strong knowledge of PHP who might be working with Omeka S.
