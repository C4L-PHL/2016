title: Introduction to VuFind
---
<p>VuFind is an open source discovery layer designed to provide a common abstraction across many different searchable data providers, including local Solr indexes and various popular discovery APIs. While it is suitable for most search tasks, its most common use case is as a front-end for an ILS, and it includes integration with most common systems. Ingest tools are included for dealing with MARC records, OAI-PMH servers and website sitemaps; working with other types of content is simple thanks to Solr’s simple API.

VuFind is built with easy configuration and extensibility in mind. Many common needs can be met simply through configuration and a bit of theming, and more advanced customizations may be cleanly achieved with the help of Zend Framework 2’s architecture, which makes building plugins and overriding core services straightforward. The default theme uses Bootstrap to provide a responsive interface, but custom mobile-specific themes may also be deployed. 

This workshop will offer an overview of VuFind’s features and architecture, assist you in installing a local instance of the software, and run through some common customization steps. The lead development team will be on hand for Q&A. Bring your questions, ideas and access to a laptop or server (preferably running Linux).
