<p>Learn how to turn your 2000+ line spaghetti monster CSS file into a modular and manageable collection of components you can reuse! 

Workshop will cover:
* overview of how to use Sass (CodeKit, Rails, libsass, etc.)
* breaking things apart (CSS Stats, SublimeText plugins, browser extensions, etc.)
* creating reusable components with variables, mixins, extends (DRYing up your code)
* organizing and naming (SMACSS and BEM)
* frameworks (Bootstrap, Foundation, Bourbon, Susy, Breakpoint, etc.)
* build tools (Grunt, Gulp, etc.)
* other topics we might discuss: PostCSS

We will work through a number of hands on exercises touching on the topics above. These exercises will require the installation of a number of command line utilities that we will guide you through. It is recommended attendees come to the workshop with a machine capable of running OSX with Homebrew or Linux. Windows users will expected to be able to run a virtual instance of Linux using a tool like VirtualBox.
