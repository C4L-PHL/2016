<p>Learn how to turn your 2000+ line spaghetti monster CSS file into a modular and manageable collection of components you can reuse!</p>

Workshop will cover:
<ul>
    <li>overview of how to use Sass (CodeKit, Rails, libsass, etc.)</li>
    <li>breaking things apart (CSS Stats, SublimeText plugins, browser extensions, etc.)</li>
    <li>creating reusable components with variables, mixins, extends (DRYing up your code)</li>
    <li>organizing and naming (SMACSS and BEM)</li>
    <li>frameworks (Bootstrap, Foundation, Bourbon, Susy, Breakpoint, etc.)</li>
    <li>build tools (Grunt, Gulp, etc.)</li>
    <li>other topics we might discuss: PostCSS</li>
</ul>

<p>
    We will work through a number of hands on exercises touching on the topics above. These exercises will require the installation of a number of command line utilities that we will guide you through. It is recommended attendees come to the workshop with a machine capable of running OSX with Homebrew or Linux. Windows users will expected to be able to run a virtual instance of Linux using a tool like VirtualBox.
