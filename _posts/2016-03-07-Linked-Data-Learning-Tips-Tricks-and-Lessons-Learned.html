title: Linked Data Learning, Tips, Tricks and Lessons Learned
---
<p>Ready to harness the power of linked data but don’t know where to start? This hands-on workshop will move you from a bystander to an active participant in the new frontier of linked data in just a few hours.  We will begin with a basic overview of linked data principles before diving into techniques and tools for consuming and producing linked data. Participants will actively manipulate linked data graphs using several tools and programming languages, including Ruby, PHP, Javascript and SPARQL. We’ll review RDFa, JSON-LD serializations, framing and how JSON-LD can be used to easily publish linked data. Participants will practice using framing to publish an existing JSON document as linked data and adding RDFa to an HTML document.</p>
