title: Live Coding Music with Sonic Pi
---
<p>Take a break from coding for work and code for fun!  Come and learn about live coding music.  We'll take a look at Sonic Pi, a live coding environment written in Ruby.  We'll go from learning how to play single notes, to chords, samples, and effects.  Put these all together in a multi-threaded environment to make some fantastic music!  Sonic Pi is a wonderful environment that can be used to teach programming to 10 year olds, but powerful enough to be used for performances at a nightclub.

Sonic Pi has a real benefit for teaching programming to kids and adults in a low cost environment.  Music is fun and accessible to a wide audience.

Extend your creativity, get your groove on, and have some fun!

If you would like to install the software before the workshop, Sonic Pi can be downloaded at http://sonic-pi.net.</p>
