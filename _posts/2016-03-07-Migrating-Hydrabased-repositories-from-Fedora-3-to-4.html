title: Migrating Hydra-based repositories from Fedora 3 to 4
---
<p>Do you have a Hydra-based repository that is still on Fedora 3? 

This is a hands-on workshop for digging into the details of performing an actual migration using the fedora-migrate [1] Ruby gem. In this session, you will be working on your own laptop with a provided Vagrant image through a series of step-by-step exercises that incrementally demonstrate how to approach such a migration.
