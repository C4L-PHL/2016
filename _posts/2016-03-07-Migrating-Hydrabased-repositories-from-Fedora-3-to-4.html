title: Migrating Hydra-based repositories from Fedora 3 to 4
---
<p>Do you have a Hydra-based repository that is still on Fedora 3? 

This is a hands-on workshop for digging into the details of performing an actual migration using the fedora-migrate [1] Ruby gem. In this session, you will be working on your own laptop with a provided Vagrant image through a series of step-by-step exercises that incrementally demonstrate how to approach such a migration.

[1] https://github.com/projecthydra-labs/fedora-migrate</p>

The workshops will include several hands-on sections using a Fedora 4 virtual machine image, so please follow these instructions to get the VM up and running on your laptop *before* the workshop. Let me know if you run into any problems - we are doing this in advance so we do not have to troubleshoot problems at the workshop.

NOTE: The VM uses 2GB of RAM, so you will need a laptop with at least 4GB of RAM to run it. Depending on your laptop manufacturer, you may also need to enable virtualization in the BIOS.

1. Download and install VirtualBox: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
2. Download and install Vagrant: http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html
3. Download and unzip the 4.4.0 release of the Fedora 4 VM: https://github.com/fcrepo4-exts/fcrepo4-vagrant/archive/c4l-2016.zip
4. Using a Command Line Interface, navigate to the VM directory from step 3 and run the command: vagrant up
    a. Note that this step will take a while as the VM downloads and installs a full virtual environment
5. Test the VM by opening your web browser and navigating to: http://localhost:8080/fcrepo
    a. The administrator username/password is fedoraAdmin/secret3

We will also be making use of the SSH command - if you are running Mac OSX or Linux you can already run this command, but if you are on Windows you will need an SSH client like [PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html).

That is it! Please let me know if you run into any problems.
Regards,
Andrew
