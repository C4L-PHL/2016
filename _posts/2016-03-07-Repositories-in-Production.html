title: Repositories in Production
---
<p>This workshop will be a discussion around topics and techniques to consider while transitioning a project into a production service. Building from a recent Hydra in Production workshop held this year at HydraConnect, the workshop is organized through a list of topics i.e.: monitoring, deployment/upgrades, staging environments, continuous integration, etc. Each topic will be discussed collectively (time allowing) on how people currently approach the concern and any tools they have familiarity with. There are a great many topics to discuss around transitioning to a production service, which is why I'm proposing this as a 1/2 day workshop rather than a breakout.

2nd (and maybe 3rd) facilitator TBD.</p>
