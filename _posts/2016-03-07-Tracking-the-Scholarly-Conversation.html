title: Tracking the Scholarly Conversation
---
<p>Which works are most significant? Which are being discussed and shared? Today, it is not possible for librarians to answer those questions by looking only at Journal Impact Factor™ or at a simple citation count. It is now common to talk about academic research outside the formal literature in places like Facebook, Wikipedia, and beyond in bookmarks, comments, social shares, and links to other research entities.  To facilitate getting to the answers, Crossref, the non-profit membership organization working to make scholarly content easy to find, cite, link, and assess, will introduce a freely available tool (coming in spring 2016) for the use of all stakeholders.  The new DET (DOI Event Tracker) will monitor and quantify the reach and frequency of discussion around scholarly works by tracking activity from potentially any web source where an event is associated with a DOI (Digital Object Identifier).  Consistent with its not-for-profit mission, Crossref will not commercialize the tool, but will make it available to all libraries, publishers, and third-parties to build upon. In this interactive session, Crossref will explain and demonstrate the new DOI Event Tracker (DET), and take feedback and questions about its functionality and potential applications.  Some features of the DET include:
•        Data on event activity across a common pool of online channels
•        Cross-publisher monitoring to enable benchmarking and provide context to the data
•        CC-0 license for open and flexible propagation of data
•        Query-initiated retrieval or real-time alerts when an event of interest occurs
•        Common format for normalizing data results across the diverse set of sources via modern REST API
