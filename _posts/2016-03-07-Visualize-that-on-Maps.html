title: Visualize that on Maps
---
<p>Are you interested in creating interactive and GIS-driven maps? Visualization is a powerful tool that provides users insight that plain textual documents cannot. Many libraries have documents and records containing addresses or traces of geographic information but donâ€™t have a good way to pull that information together in a usable arrangement. 

This workshop will provide participants with hands-on experience to extract geographic information from text, to create a GeoJSon file to represent the geographic features, and then to visualize the information via Google Maps using Google Maps JavaScript API. We will also show how to manipulate the Google Maps created by using JQuery.
