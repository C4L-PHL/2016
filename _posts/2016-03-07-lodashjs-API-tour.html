title: lodash.js API tour
---
<p>Have you heard of functional JavaScript libraries like Underscore and lodash [1], but never had time to learn the API? Have you thought about data processing with JavaScript for mapping and visualization? Do you have a need for performant, cross-browser code that is easy to maintain and debug? Then join us for this half-day workshop exploring the lodash.js API through a hands-on “koans-style” [2] experience! All are welcome, but basic familiarity with JavaScript is recommended, e.g. the concepts covered in the Codecademy [3] or Udacity [4] JavaScript courses.
