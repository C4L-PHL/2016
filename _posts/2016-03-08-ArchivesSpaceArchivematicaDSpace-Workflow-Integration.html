title: ArchivesSpace-Archivematica-DSpace Workflow Integration
---
<p>In April 2014, the Bentley Historical Library received a $355,000 grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to partner with the University of Michigan Library and Artefactual Systems on the integration of ArchivesSpace, Archivematica, and DSpace in an end-to-end digital archives workflow.  The project seeks to expedite the ingest, description, and overall curation of digital archives by facilitating (a) the review and characterization of newly acquired content, (b) the creation and reuse of descriptive and administrative metadata among emerging platforms and (c) the deposit of fully processed content into a digital preservation repository.  This presentation will identify key project goals and outcomes and demonstrate features and functionality of Archivematica's new 'Appraisal and Arrangement' tab developed by Artefactual Systems.</p>
