<p>Awardee of an IMLS Sparks! Ignition Grant, the Library Application for Study Space Engagement will deliver timely, usable data of the occupancy of students' favorite study spaces in the University of Rochester Libraries.  It will do so via a native mobile application leveraging just our existing wi-fi infrastructure and web-friendly data visualization techniques.  This talk will review decisions on project milestones, interpreting wi-fi data, architecting a native mobile application on a lean project cycle, and actualizing the assessment implications of this newly unearthed spatial data. </p>
