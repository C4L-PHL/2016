title: Build your own identity hub
---
<p>Libraries, archives, and museums have begun publishing Linked Open Data (LOD). Yet for many technical teams working in these organizations, the path towards implementing tools or services that both benefit users and utilize LOD remains elusive or out of reach.

This talk will walk the audience through identifying and creating a useful, lightweight "identity hub" of academic journals. It will cover interlinking multiple sources of data and publishing as LOD using a Linked Data Fragments  (LDF) server, and embedding useful contextual information in existing web pages. 

All data and code used to produce the "identity hub" will be shared. The principles of interlinking and publishing will be applicable to other types of data.</p>
