title: Building Desktop Applications using Web Technologies with Electron
---
<p>Everything that was once a desktop application has gone to the cloud and no one builds desktop applications anymore, right? Wrong. Companies like Github, Slack, and a number of startups are building desktop applications today. Why? I'll show you why desktop applications are still preferred sometimes, how you can use the web technologies you're already familiar with (HTML, CSS, & JavaScript) to build them, and some reasons why you will want to consider creating a desktop application even if you've always written them off in the past. We'll see how easy it is to get started and what's different about this model of programming like how processes can communicate. I'll tie this all back to examples of library and archives use cases for desktop applications.</p>
