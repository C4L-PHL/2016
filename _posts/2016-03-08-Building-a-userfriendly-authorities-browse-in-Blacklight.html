title: Building a user-friendly authorities browse in Blacklight
---
<p>When Cornell switched from Voyager to Blacklight as the main catalog interface, one of the requirements given to the development team was to create an authorities-augmented headings browse that would replace the Voyager headings browse. In this talk we'll discuss the work that went into both Solr and Blacklight development in order to create a good user experience for the browse functionality.
