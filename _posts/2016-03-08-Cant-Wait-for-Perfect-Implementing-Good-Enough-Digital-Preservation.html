title: Can’t Wait for Perfect&#58; Implementing “Good Enough” Digital Preservation
slides: '/slides/001-Cant_Wait_for_Perfect.pdf'
---
<p>By now there is wide consensus within the field regarding the technical, practical, and policy requirements of maintaining digital information over time. But the reality is that digital preservation done right is hugely expensive, and few institutions have the resources necessary to meet the stringent requirements that the standards demand. We’ll cover several tools, strategies, and skills implemented both during and beyond our National Digital Stewardship Residencies to help you safeguard your digital content regardless of your institution’s size or budget. In short, ‘perfect’ is never going to happen, so there’s no reason to wait. This talk will equip you to step up your digital preservation game no matter how far along your program is (even if it’s non-existent!). </p>
