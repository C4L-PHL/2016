title: Code4Accessibility&#58; Avalon’s steps forward
---
<p>The Avalon Media System is an open source system for managing and providing access to large collections of digital audio and video. The freely available system enables libraries and archives to easily curate, distribute and provide online access to their collections for purposes of teaching, learning and research.  

For Avalon Media System 4.0, our team worked with Indiana University's UITS Assistive Technology and Accessibility Centers to identify improvements to Avalon's accessibility.  We know that many development projects are starting to look closely at accessibility features, and we will discuss the priorities, scoping and design that went into our latest features – a focus on keyboard functionality -  as well as discuss our next steps for greater accessibility to Avalon for everyone. </p>
