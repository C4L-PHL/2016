title: College Women&#58; A Collaborative Digital Collection
---
<p>College Women (http://www.collegewomen.org) provides access to digital versions of letters, diaries, scrapbooks and photographs documenting the first generations of women students attending the northeastern colleges once known as the “Seven Sisters,” the women’s college counterparts to the all-male Ivy League schools. These seven institutions educated many of the most privileged, ambitious, socially-conscious, and intellectually-committed women in the country during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and sent their graduates into path-breaking careers in philanthropy, public service, education, and the arts.

Through this project, our collective project team explored the complexities of building a rich collection of materials and objects from these institutions. Our panel will discuss the process of developing a successful grant; the technical considerations of building this type of project; our concerns and solutions to metadata importing; and the process of successfully managing a project across a range of geographically diverse groups. We will demonstrate the newly launched project to the group during this session.</p>
