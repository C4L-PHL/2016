title: Cutting Through the Clutter&#58; Simplifying Discovery in Multi-type Consortiums
---
<p>Marmot Library Network and the Nashville Public Library both support discovery for libraries of various types (public, academic, and school). They also share the issues that arise from supporting such different audiences and needs under the same interface.

With this setup come a number of challenges including:
- MARC records from a variety of sources (SkyRiver, OCLC, self cataloged)
- Accounts and Records in different ILSs
- eContent from a large number of sources (OverDrive, Hoopla, EBSCO, ebrary, SpringerLink, etc)
- Patrons with multiple accounts for different libraries
- Libraries that want their own look and feel to the catalog
- Different relevancy needs

In all cases, end users expect a single discovery layer that hides all of this complexity from them.

Marmot, Nashville, and 5 other libraries have worked together on our open source Pika discovery layer to implement creative solutions for these issues.  This session will talk about some of the unique features in Pika, some technical challenges we have faced, as well as how we work collaboratively to plan new functionality.
