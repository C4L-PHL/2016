title: DH Box&#58; A Virtual Computer Lab in the Cloud
---
<p>DH Box is a cloud-based platform designed to give teachers, students, and scholars ready access to a suite of tools that facilitate research and collaboration. 

DH Box allows teachers to instantly deploy a “computer lab” in the cloud, obviating the need for repetitive installation and configuration tasks. By simplifying this process, DH Box allows users at a variety of skill levels to focus on learning and exploring with DH tools, rather than getting bogged down in setup. And because DH Box is compatible with many different devices and operating systems, students and teachers can access DH tools from their own favored devices, rather than from an assigned lab machine, reducing dependence on institutional resources that are often scarce or inaccessible. 

We will discuss the utility of the DH Box platform in the library and academic context, focusing on the evolving role librarians can play in enabling the use of tools for data and text analysis.</p>
