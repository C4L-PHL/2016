title: Developing a Homegrown ERMS
---
<p>In 2011, the University of Pittsburgh Health Sciences Library System (HSLS) was licensing an expensive Electronic Resource Management System (ERMS) that communicated poorly with our Integrated Library System (ILS), provided no individual title detail or usage statistics for non-journal e-resources, and did not offer an intuitive user interface. With the ERMS license due for renewal, we had four options: (1) continue with the current product and hope for improvements, (2) move to a new licensed tool, (3) adapt an open-source tool, or (4) build our own ERM from scratch. Knowing that the first option was never really an option and how much work the fourth option would be, we had high hopes for options two and three. Unfortunately, none of the proprietary or open-source tools we examined in our environmental scan met the library’s needs. 

This talk will introduce HERMIT, the HSLS Electronic Resource Management and Information Tool, focusing on five key stages in the development process:
•        Gathering needs requirements through Initial surveys and interviews with potential stakeholders and users
•        Adapting the Digital Library Federation’s Electronic Resource Management Initiative to meet our needs 
•        Building the Web-based product using CakePHP 
•        Testing and launch in 2012
•        Ongoing maintenance and additional features

In addition to sharing our experiences developing a complex library tool, this talk will also demonstrate HERMIT’s features including:
•        Individual title detail
•        Near real-time data sharing with our ILS
•        Usage statistics
•        Vendor and contact data
•        Reporting
