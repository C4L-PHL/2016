title: Digital Preservation 101, or, How to Keep Bits for Centuries
---
<p>This presentation will cover the Open Archival Information System (OAIS) model for long-term digital preservation. It will also cover preferred file formats for long-term storage; a small detour through digital forensics, FRED machines, and retrocomputing; and why archivists cry themselves to sleep at night when the general public conflates “archives” with “backup copies” of data.</p>
