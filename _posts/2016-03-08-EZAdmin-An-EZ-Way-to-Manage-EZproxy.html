title: EZAdmin&#58; An EZ Way to Manage EZproxy
---
<p>Teaching non-technical library staff how to manage EZproxy configurations can be difficult. This presentation will discuss a free, open source tool that provides a web interface for library staff to edit resource configurations and easily export them into one or several EZproxy configuration files. This presentation will demonstrate how the interface works from the user perspective and also discuss how the tool is implemented on the proxy server and in the MySQL database.</p>
