title: Exploring interactivity with display walls
---
<p>At the James B. Hunt Jr. Library at NC State University, we have 5 large video walls that provide a canvas for content development and exploration. Although we have developed a significant content portfolio for these spaces over the past 3 years, much of this content is static in nature. One of our ongoing goals is to increase opportunities for library patrons to interact with the content on these displays. We have been experimenting with techniques ranging from simple QR codes to home-built motion sensors to Microsoft Kinects achieve these goals. This talk would explore a range of technologies and techniques that could be used to transform a static display space into an interactive information environment.</p>
