title: From GenericFiles to CurationConcerns&#58;  the code behind a new generation of data models in Sufia and the Hydra Project
---
<p>The Hydra Project has seen a flurry of activity around data models in the past year, resulting in a new set of Ruby gems that embody years of collaboration and iteration across multiple institutions.  These new gems, built around the Portland Common Data Model (PCDM), allow Hydra adopters to represent their content's structure consistently while retaining full freedom to choose metadata and workflows that suit their needs.  

The new gems are hydra-pcdm, hydra-works, curation_concerns and Sufia 7.  Each of the gems in this list builds on the preceding ones, providing a higher level of abstraction to suit a different layer of needs. In this way, they function like a stack of optional components that also relies on existing Hydra components like active-fedora, hydra-head, and hydra-access-controls.

This presentation will explain how the new gems fit together and how they leverage PCDM and established conventions to achieve a potent balance between consistency and flexibility.</p>
