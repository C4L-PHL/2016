title: Guerrilla Usability Testing and Communicating Value
---
<p>Usability testing is often more of a black box process than it needs to be. The outcomes of testing can directly impact development, create new project directions, smooth out contentious issues, and act as a communication bridge between different stakeholder groups. Testing at all stages of a project can also help to prevent costly end-stage failures. Despite these benefits, usability testing is still often viewed as overly time consuming and resource intensive. 

This talk will outline an approach to low-cost, fast-paced usability testing and provide strategies for communicating progress and value to stakeholders at all levels of the process. It will demonstrate the importance of guerrilla testing in a common project management workflow and provide examples of how to communicate process and results.</p>
