title: How not to waste catalogers' time&#58; Making the most of subject headings
---
<p>The subject descriptions of well-cataloged library resources have
rich semantics, but most online catalogs and discovery systems do not take
full advantage of them, and the headings assigned by librarians do not always match the descriptions users expect. This session features
ideas, demonstrations, and discussion on how we can improve the design and the data in our catalogs and discovery systems to improve discovery
of relevant materials.  It will focus on how to better take advantage of the kinds of data that catalogers already create.  

Topics to be discussed include:

  -- How to take advantage of subject heading order in summaries 
      and in relevance ranking of user searches.
  -- How to use relationships between subject headings, both those
      explicitly stated in authority data, and those that can be
      automatically inferred from data, to improve browsing and search.
  -- How to exploit the respective strengths (and work around the respective
       weaknesses) of LCSH, FAST, and Wikipedia in subject searches.</p>
