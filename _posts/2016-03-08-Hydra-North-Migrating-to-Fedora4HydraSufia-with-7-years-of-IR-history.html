title: Hydra North&#58; Migrating to Fedora4/Hydra/Sufia with 7 years of IR history
---
<p>University of Alberta Libraries is currently building a centralized Digital Assets Management System (DAMS) to consolidate various digital platforms and repositories we have developed over the years, including a 7-year-old institutional repository based on Fedora 3. The new system is based on Fedora4/Hydra/Sufia stack. Phase 1 of the project was to focus on the implementation of institutional repository functionality and the migration of digital objects from the existing system.  The new system was launched successfully in Oct 2015, and inevitably with a few stumbles and tumbles along the way. In this presentation we will have an overview of the steps we took to plan and execute the content and service migration, the expected and unexpected challenges we faced during the application deployment and the migrations,  and the valuable lessons we have learnt.</p>
