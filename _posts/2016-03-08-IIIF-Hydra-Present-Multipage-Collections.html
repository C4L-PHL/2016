title: IIIF Hydra? Present Multipage Collections
---
<p>When faced with a task of digitally displaying a large collection of works by one of dentistry's all-time greats, Greene Vardiman Black, we wanted to use the popular Sufia Rails engine from Project Hydra, but we also wanted features that Sufia lacked. By using Sufia 6 as a base, we opted for implementation of hierarchical, multi-page, IIIF-backed Collections that are viewed through the OpenSeadragon viewer. We achieved our goal while keeping the code-base easily maintainable and upgradeable. The first step was to allow Collections to contain other collections and to allow hierarchical structure among them.The second step involved the use of an existing EAD XML finding aid from which appropriate metadata was added to the corresponding Collections and GenericFiles models. This enabled us to load the GV Black collection while preserving its complete hierarchy. The resulting separated pages had an unwanted effect as they cluttered our catalog, the facets, and the word cloud. To mitigate the clutter, we created a new class called Page that inherits from GenericFile. We anticipate that some of our users will prefer to download whole documents and not just  individual pages. For this reason, we created a two-way relationship between Collections and Pages containing combined PDFs. Riiif, being a Rails engine, was a natural choice for our IIIF service. We were able to make Riiif respect existing authorization rules and with Riiif fetching everything it needs from Blacklight, we avoid the additional slowness of interacting with Fedora. We then implemented our own IIIF presentation API for use with the viewer. Finally, since Blacklight includes OpenSeadragon it was an obvious choice as our IIIF viewer. The overall result is a discoverable collection with a slick presentation front-end where one can interact with the collections in two different ways: viewing high-resolution previewable TIFs or downloading multi-page downsampled PDFs.</p>
