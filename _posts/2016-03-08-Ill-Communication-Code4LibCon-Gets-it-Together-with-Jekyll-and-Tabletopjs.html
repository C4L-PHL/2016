title: Ill Communication&#58; Code4LibCon Gets it Together with Jekyll and Tabletop.js
---
<p>When you want to welcome fresh perspectives and diverse voices, first impressions make a difference. While the code4lib website and wiki have traditionally served as the focal point for code4libcon information, they can be confusing, even to long time community members. This year, organizers decided to overhaul how we present conference information. Our primary goal: make the experience more welcoming to first timers and long time community members alike. Similarly, if we wanted to convince sponsors that code4lib represents the latest and greatest in library technology, our site needed to look the part.

We wanted to relieve the kind OSU folks of the albatross we've become, but we also couldn't pay anyone to host the site. We decided that GitHub Pages and Jekyll, a static site generator, was the best solution as it would allow for community participation, would be performant, and would work with structured data files.  We will demonstrate how anyone with a GitHub account can make changes, report bugs, and suggest enhancements to the conference site.  

While Jekyll does democratize the process of site development, there are still technical barriers that could get in the way of proposal submissions and other user contributed content.  How do you allow anyone to contribute content to a statically generated site in a performant way?  We will also demonstrate our innovative approach to this challenge using Tabletop.js, and get you all up to speed on how to run a data-driven site on the cheap.</p>
