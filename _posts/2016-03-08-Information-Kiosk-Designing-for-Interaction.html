title: Information Kiosk&#58; Designing for Interaction
---
<p>At the beginning of the Summer of 2015 we received funding for 2 standing kiosks and 2 touch monitors for the purpose of creating a building directory for the library. We designed an interface to give students, faculty, and guests an easy way to find people, books, and library spaces in a friendly unmediated manner. In addition we created a way to survey users about  topics on which we would like their input, and a Quiz that highlighted our resources and provided prizes for participants.The library is open 24 hours and the library is not staffed overnight. To create the interface we created a Drupal View and worked with campus to set up windows seven PCs to create a kiosk experience that was safe for us and responsive for the users. </p>
