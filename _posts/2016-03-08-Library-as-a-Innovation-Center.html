title: Library as a Innovation Center
---
<p>We are currently at a time where hardware manufacturing cost has been dramatically reduced. The Arduino, RasperryPi has placed limitless possibilities for programmer. This session will focus on how library identifies applications which is very costly but might be a good candidate to develop in house using RasperryPi. The speaker will talk about the digital display system that we are using right now based off RasperryPi at the cost of under $100 serves the same purpose and function as the ones company could charge at least $1000. The exciting part of this case study is to show that we are at a revolutionary time for making products in house. The speaker will talk about the possibility of developing low cost collaborative Table, touch screen interactive screen, etc that might eventually make the library an innovation center for the university and for the local community. </p>
