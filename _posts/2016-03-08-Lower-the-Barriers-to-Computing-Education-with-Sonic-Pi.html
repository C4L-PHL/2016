title: Lower the Barriers to Computing Education with Sonic Pi
---
<p>How can we lower the barriers to teaching programming to kids and adults?  Let’s use music!  By using Sonic Pi software on a Raspberry Pi, Mac, or Windows computer, kids and adults alike can learn how to program by creating their own music.  We’ll take a short tour through Sonic Pi and see how easy it is to make some great tunes while learning real programming concepts.</p>
