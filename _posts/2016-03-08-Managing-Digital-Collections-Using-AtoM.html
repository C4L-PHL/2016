title: Managing Digital Collections Using AtoM
---
<p>Access to Memory (AtoM) is an open-source application for standards-based description and access in a multilingual, multi-repository environment. Built around the concept of easy-to-use templates based on international and national content standards, AtoM was originally developed for use in an archival context. However, the flexible nature of the application makes it easy to adapt and use in a library special collections context without further development. This session will discuss the history and mission of the AtoM project and introduce users to some of AtoM's powerful features, including built-in crosswalking between standards templates, user interface label and menu customization, digital object support, digital rights management, and integration with the open-source digital preservation system Archivematica. </p>
