title: Metadata Crosswalk with RDF Modeling
---
<p>This talk outlines a recent project at Oregon State University Library that uses a RDF-based approach to metadata crosswalk for semantic interoperability. The goal is migrating and transforming the metadata records of 60,000 digital works stored in DSpace from Dublin Core (DC) qualifier standard into triple statements for improvements in data sharing. RDF is used as a model to represent the contextual relationships implicitly embedded between described objects, such as an article with its associated datasets, a degree and its offering department, and an advisor to the graduate student. A ruby gem is developed to transform the DC records exported from DSpace into a series triple statements based on the defined RDF model with linked data paradigm. This talk will describe this transforming process with three primary use cases, which can be helpful for other institutes that are in the process of metadata enhancement or migration.</p>
