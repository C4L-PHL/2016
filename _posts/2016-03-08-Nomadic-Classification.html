title: Nomadic Classification
---
<p>The New York Public Library has used a number of classification systems to catalog materials over its 120 year history. These include a local system developed in 1899 by the library's first president, a number of fixed order schemas and dozens of various classmarks used in our research divisions. This talk will explore how we are using linked open data to build concordances between our local classification and external systems such as LCC. It will also look at how we are pushing the boundary of our classification by mapping to nontraditional classification systems such as Wikidata. (An early prototype can be seen here: http://billi.nypl.org)</p>
