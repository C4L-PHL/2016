title: Practical Digital Forensics at Accession for Born-Digital Institutional Records
---
<p>Archivists have developed a consensus that forensic disk imaging is the most effective way to manage born-digital records and preserve contextual metadata. Yet, disk imaging also has the potential to preserve deleted records and other unexpected information â€“ posing a significant problem for the management of institutional records that are assigned to records retention schedules. This issue can be particularly hazardous for archives that are governed by public records laws.

I will discuss these issues and the development of a proof-of-concept python desktop application. This tool runs basic forensics tools to extract filesystem metadata we can get depending on administrator rights, add creator description, package files with checksums, and transfer them over network shares or FTP. While the metadata we can gather at accession now is limited, the evolution of forensics tools may provide better results in the future, and the knowledge of these tools can help us to better evaluate the benefits and drawbacks of disk imaging for institutional records.</p>
