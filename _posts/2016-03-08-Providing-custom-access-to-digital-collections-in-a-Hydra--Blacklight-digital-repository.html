title: Providing custom access to digital collections in a Hydra + Blacklight digital repository.
---
<p>Since 2011 Duke University Libraries has published digital collections in a home-grown Django application that provides a customized interface to collections, including featured images, and ways to search and browse the metadata for each collection (see http://library.duke.edu/digitalcollections/hleewaters/). In 2015 we began ingesting and publishing digital collections using the libraryâ€™s Hydra + Blacklight based digital repository. With digital collections being published alongside items as diverse as datasets, GIS data, and meeting notes, we were challenged to find a way to customize the repository to provide meaningful and useful discovery and access to digital collections.

Among the unique customizations Duke has implemented in Blacklight are 1) attractive, configurable portal pages for collections, including highlighted items and facets fine-tuned for an optimal user experience; 2) IIIF-based image handling; 3) semantic URLs and 4) a local Bootstrap theme for a branded UI. (See our first digital collection published in our new Hydra + Blacklight based system: https://repository.lib.duke.edu/dc/wdukesons). Developers will share relevant user data and their experiences with Blacklight to accommodate the uniqueness of different digital collections within a shared platform.
