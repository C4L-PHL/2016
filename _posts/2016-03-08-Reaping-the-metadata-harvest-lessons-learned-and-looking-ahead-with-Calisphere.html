title: Reaping the metadata harvest&#58; lessons learned and looking ahead with Calisphere
---
<p>Since 2014, the California Digital Library (CDL) has been piloting the use of a metadata harvesting infrastructure to aggregate unique collections from across the 10-campus University of California library system -- and libraries, archives, and museums throughout the state. These collections are now available through the newly redesigned Calisphere (http://calisphere.cdlib.org/) website in addition to the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA). Our relatively new metadata harvesting infrastructure, which adapts DPLA's early code base, has made it easier for contributors to share collections. We're now able to aggregate a much larger range of resources than before: 400,000 objects are now available in Calisphere -- an immediate 70% increase in content from the previous site. However, there are challenges to scaling and streamlining our processes, from the point of staging collections for harvest, through to quality control checking results. This talk will highlight where we've been with metadata aggregation, and where we're planning to go.  We'll discuss points of pain and lessons learned with the existing infrastructure. We'll also report on new requirements that we've developed, and directions that we are planning to take to improve on and ramp up our processes.</p>
