title: Refining Proxy Logs Into Intelligible Usage Data
---
<p>Like many institutions, the University of Minnesota Libraries have sought a comprehensive view of electronic resource usage comprising database searches, electronic journal and electronic book access across internal applications and tens or hundreds of vendor platforms. More than raw access counts, we desire a view of those data which can be utilized by subject librarians to understand electronic resource usage patterns across academic units of interest to them.

We will discuss some of our solutions to distilling resource usage out of proxy logfiles and resolving identifiers (for example ISSN, ISBN, or DOI) in conjunction with Shibboleth user attributes identifying academic affiliations to build a relational database agnostic of any user interface or business intelligence tool we wish to attach to it. Perhaps more importantly, we will share what we've learned through this undertaking, the tiers of accuracy we have been able to achieve, and the challenges of balancing patron privacy with the data specificity desired by our subject librarians.</p>
