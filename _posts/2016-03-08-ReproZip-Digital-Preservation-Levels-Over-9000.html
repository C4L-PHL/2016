title: ReproZip&#58; Digital Preservation Levels Over 9000!!!
---
<p>An age-old (read: ten year) battle in digital preservation has been the struggle between migration and emulation. Which is better? How can we better both archive reproducible material and reproduce archival material for the future? 

ReproZip is a potential solution! ReproZip is an open-source tool developed at NYU that packs a digital object, experiment, etc. along with all the necessary data files, libraries, environment variables, etc. necessary to reproduce it, throwing it into a .rpz compressed file. That .rpz file can be used in ReproUnzip, the flip-side program that anybody can use to then reproduce the experiment without making the user track down and install the dependencies or even having to run the same operating system!

While the majority of the use cases for ReproZip have come out of quantitative research, there has been a push into library science when it comes to making archival snapshots of databases and LIS systems, as well as using ReproZip to reproduce/recreate library research and digital materials. 

In this talk, I'll explore the potential of ReproZip in a library setting, particularly a digital preservation setting. I'll discuss how the packing and unpacking of environments, software, and experiments can contribute to a greater potential of reproducibility through digital libraries.
