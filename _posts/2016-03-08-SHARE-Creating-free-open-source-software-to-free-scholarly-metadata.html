title: SHARE&#58; Creating free, open source software to free scholarly (meta)data
---
<p>Openness is inclusivity, and open data fosters innovation. But access to scholarly (meta)data is exclusive, and innovation is stifled. As long as this data is closed and/or programmatically inaccessible, only the copyright owners and/or groups that purchase/license the rights can create tools using that data. For example, no one can build a competitive open source Google Scholar. Theses and dissertations cannot produce the next Scopus or Web of Science. Further, scholars outside of these groups cannot conduct meta-science/scholarship. Scholars cannot use their own methods to study themselves--they have no data. SHARE looks to change this.

SHARE--a collaboration between ARL, AAU, APLU, and the Center for Open Science--is building a free, open data set about research and scholarly activities across their life cycle. Built on an entirely free, open source software stack, SHARE is collecting, connecting, and enhancing metadata that describes research activities and outputs--from data management plans and grant proposals to preprints, journal articles, and data repository deposits.

This presentation will cover the goals, challenges, and software stack of SHARE, culminating in an invitation to get involved. There is plenty of work to do, and SHARE is a community-based project. There are no competitors, only collaborators. Anyone can contribute, no matter their technical skill level. Openness, after all, is inclusivity.</p>
