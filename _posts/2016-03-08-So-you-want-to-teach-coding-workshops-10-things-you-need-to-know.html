title: So you want to teach coding workshops? 10 things you need to know
---
<p>A Systems Librarian and a System Admin got together to teach programming for the non-programmer in the library. Learn about the challenges we faced: how we prepared, what worked, what didn't, and what would we change? 

We will discuss the guidelines we used on how to plan and deliver coding workshops in a library setting and on a budget of $0. We developed a series of workshops to be taught over the academic year to faculty, students and staff who were interested in coding and but needed an open and neutral environment and some guidance to start and learn. We will also discuss more specific logistics like: how we determined who we needed on our team, delegating tasks and involving outside parties in planning and teaching, advertising strategies, and workshop topic selections.</p>
