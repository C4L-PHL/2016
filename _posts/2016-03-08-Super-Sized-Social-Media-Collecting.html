title: Super Sized Social Media Collecting
---
<p>GW Libraries developed and released Social Feed Manager (SFM) in 2012 to help faculty and students study collections of tweets.  SFM has been a useful workhorse in providing this new service to researchers and archivists at GW and beyond, but over three years of practical and sometimes painful experience in this area led us to rethink our approach.  We’ll describe how we’re rebuilding the app from the ground up to create a more archivist- and researcher-friendly, sustainable service which is easier to deploy and allows users to define their own social media collection strategies without mediation.  Its new modular design scales up to harvest from several platforms including Twitter, Flickr, Tumblr, Sina Weibo, and potentially more platforms and at greater volume.  We’ll discuss our approaches to using process scheduling, queueing, containerized deployment, export and delivery, using the WARC format to store social media content, using messaging to connect multiple harvesters, along with our specification for writing new harvesters to integrate with SFM.  Cultural heritage and research institutions now recognize the value of building collections of social media content for research and archival purposes, and we hope SFM might provide a solid foundation for doing so at your institution. </p>
