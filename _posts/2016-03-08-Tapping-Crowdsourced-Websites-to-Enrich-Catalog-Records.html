title: Tapping Crowdsourced Websites to Enrich Catalog Records
---
<p>Michigan State University Libraries recently received a gift of over 680,000 music CD titles. Its sheer quantity posed an unprecedented challenge in providing access to this trove of commercially available music titles. After programmatic checking on existing holdings in local catalog and OCLC WorldCat for copy records, almost 60% of the items remained uncataloged and required original cataloging. Though the donor provided some Dublin Core-like metadata for each title, the brief MARC record derived from these data are far from ideal. In order to improve the quality of these brief records, crowdsourced music websites like Discog.com and MusicBrainz are tapped. This presentation will talk about how to enrich these records by harvesting metadata from these two sites through their APIs using XSLT, and capturing authorized form of names of artist by following external links recorded in artistsâ€™ profile pages. The speaker will also discuss limitations of this process and difficulties in reconciling data from these two sources.</p>
