title: Text Frequency Analysis of Three Orchestration Treatises
---
<p>This report looks at three treatises on orchestration that were written around the turn of the twentieth century, and draw conclusions on the content based on text mining and analysis. It then compares the results and determine possible reasons for differences and similarities. The question being answered is what effect, if any, does date of publication and authorâ€™s main area of employment have on topics discussed in a treatise on orchestration? To answer this question, I analyzed three texts gathered from the Internet Archive using the online software Voyant Tools. </p>
