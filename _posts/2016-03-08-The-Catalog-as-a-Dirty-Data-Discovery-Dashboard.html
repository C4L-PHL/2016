title: The Catalog as a Dirty Data Discovery Dashboard
---
<p>Blacklightâ€™s Solr-powered search expands the traditional catalog from an inventory to a full-fledged discovery system. While the faceting and sorting features present the user with a powerful toolbox for finding content, they also expose improperly-formated and invalid data. This talk will go through some of the strategies utilized by the Princeton University Library to identify and isolate records with unusual publication dates, locations, and names. By using Blacklight to uncover dirty data, we can improve the quality of our catalog records and improve the search experience for our users.</p>
