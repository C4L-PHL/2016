title: The Costner Fallacy&#58; When Repoing Fails to Share Code and What to Do About It
---
<p>Most of us do it. We post code to public repositories in the hopes that others may benefit from our efforts. To paraphrase a popular Kevin Costner movie, "If we share it, they will come [and use it]." The reality, however, is that sharing code does not guarantee use by others. As library technologists, we lack a reassuring mysterious voice. A large project failing to attract an audience is disappointing, but perhaps more egregious is when the shared code is meant to fix existing technology issues and needs. Such code might include some HTML/CSS to improve the UI of an online catalog; a JavaScript snippet to address an accessibility issue in an ILL service; a small code package to provide a needed feature that the vendor says is coming soon. These aren't large projects but their contributions can be significant, especially to libraries that lack the resources to develop their own code. Ensuring that these snippet solutions can be readily implemented involves addressing a myriad of issues: composability, customization, different skill levels, and organization.  Drawing on research of technology adoption and direct experiences in contributing code for a shared ILS in a library alliance, I will discuss these issues and recommend some best practices to ensure that we build matters.</p>
