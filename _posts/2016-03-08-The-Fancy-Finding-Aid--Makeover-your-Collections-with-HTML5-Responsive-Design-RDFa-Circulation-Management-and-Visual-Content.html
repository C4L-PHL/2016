title: The Fancy Finding Aid&#58;  Makeover your Collections with HTML5, Responsive Design, RDFa, Circulation Management, and Visual Content
---
<p>Do your finding aids look a bit â€¦ dated?  Perhaps you wrote that EAD-to-HTML XSLT a decade ago?  Take advantage of contemporary development and design tools -- engage users and promote collections!  This talk will discuss a finding aid makeover, using existing JavaScript libraries and CSS templates to create finding aids with interactive and responsive design, mobile-friendly image galleries, linked data, and patron request features.  We will discuss development of, and user feedback on, The Fancy Finding Aid.</p>
