title: The Library Digital Privacy Pledge of 2015
---
<p>The Library Freedom Project is inviting the library community – libraries, vendors that serve libraries, and membership organizations – to sign the “Library Digital Privacy Pledge of 2015”. For this first pledge, we’re focusing on the use of HTTPS to deliver library services and the information resources offered by libraries. It’s just a first step: HTTPS is a privacy prerequisite, not a privacy solution. Building a culture of library digital privacy will not end with this 2015 pledge, but committing to this first modest step together will begin a process that won’t turn back. We aim to gather momentum and raise awareness with this pledge; and will develop similar pledges in the future as appropriate to advance digital privacy practices for library patrons.

This talk will discuss HTTPS in theory and in practice, practical difficulties in implementing the pledge, and if time allows, will amusingly demonstrate exploits that HTTPS prevents.</p>
