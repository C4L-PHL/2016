title: The Niiyama Japanese Poetic Pottery&#58; Enhancing its Display in Interactive Digital Form
---
<p>From the compilation of this exemplary collection of short poems of the Ogura Hyakunin Isshu in 1235 to its interpretation in ceramics exhibited at the Tokyo American Club in 1981, this presentation will examine the interactive digital transformation of a collection of one hundred pieces of pottery displayed using a combination of HTML, PHP, CSS3, and Javascript using the jQuery library. Along with these existing technologies, Object2VR was used to produce a programmatically generated interactive display from the multiple generated images. 

Through his work, the potter Mitsuya Niiyama reveals the nature of Japanese sensitivity. The purpose of this presentation is three-fold: 1) Demonstrate the collaborative work of the digitization process across areas of interest inside and outside an academic library, 2) Explore the innovative process in the production of an interactive presentation by getting the most out of existing tools and by integrating other types of tools such as Object2VR and 3) Find solutions in the making of a website when the balance between visual appeal and practical design is key to render information accessible in a variety of formats.
