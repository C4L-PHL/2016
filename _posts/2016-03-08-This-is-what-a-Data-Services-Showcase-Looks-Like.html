title: This is what a Data Services Showcase Looks Like
---
<p>The Data Services model at many institutions follows a traditional software support, data reference/finding, and data management framework, usually using the reference interview as a platform to engage users about their data problems. 

At NYU, we've expanded on this model. So much cool data comes through our doors from students and researchers alike, and we are sick of seeing it leave!! So, we've begun collecting and showcasing it using an existing CMS platform and integrating with other key areas of collection, such as our Spatial Data Repository. 

We'll talk about the process of getting this up and running, our hosting platform and choices, policy/IP considerations, and integration with institutional repositories (use ALL the APIs!). </p>
