title: UX designers and metadata librarians bringing collections together, together
---
<p>In an effort to provide a single access point for our digital collections, we have created a new digital collections interface, which is built in Blacklight and pulls metadata from both a vendor API and our hydra repository. Weâ€™ll cover the close collaboration between UX designers and metadata librarians that made the site possible, and the process the two groups used to select core facets and fields that allow for searching across collections. We'll also talk about improvements to the user experience for our image collections, plus the reduced need for separate websites, which improves the discoverability of individual items, while maintaining the context and meaning of the collections.</p>
