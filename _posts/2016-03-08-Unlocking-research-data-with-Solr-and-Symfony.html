title: Unlocking research data with Solr and Symfony
---
<p>What happens to the data that's produced by a scientific study after all the articles are published? All too often, that data languishes under researchers' desks, never again to see the light of day -- on personal thumb drives, external hard drives, or even Zip drives. But recently, the research community has been seeing how beneficial the sharing and reuse of their data can be. 

This presentation will describe how an academic medical library created a web-based search interface specifically geared towards research datasets. Using the Symfony PHP framework, the Apache Solr search engine, and a lot of metadata expertise from our librarians, we created a fast and functional search engine that can help researchers reduce costs and prevent duplicated work by providing information about existing datasets, and easy ways to contact the data's owners. The NYUHSL Data Catalog (https://datacatalog.med.nyu.edu) is a faceted, fully-featured search tool, and also includes an administrative interface so librarians can add, edit or delete items in the index themselves without requesting help from the development team. 

With RDF output in the form of JSON-LD and an open source version coming to GitHub, it is hoped that this tool (or at least the metadata in it) will be used and reused by researchers and institutions the world over.</p>
