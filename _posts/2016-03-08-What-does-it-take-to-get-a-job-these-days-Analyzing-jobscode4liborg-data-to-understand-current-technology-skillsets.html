title: What does it take to get a job these days? Analyzing jobs.code4lib.org data to understand current technology skillsets
---
<p>The jobs.code4lib.org site contains years of usefully-structured data that gives us a unique view into who we are as a community.   A holistic look at this data yields numerous insights â€“ what to teach, what to learn, where to focus our technical efforts, and the emergence (and decline) of technology trends.  This talk will describe the data collected by the code4lib jobs site and the text analysis performed for research purposes, which has yielded multiple publications.  The talk will conclude with an open call for possible future collaborations or applications of this data within the code4lib community. </p>
