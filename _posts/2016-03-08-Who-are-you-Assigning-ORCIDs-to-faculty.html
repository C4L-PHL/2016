title: Who are you? Assigning ORCIDs to faculty.
---
<p>If every researcher acquired and ORCID and used it with every publication, the name disambiguation problem would resolve itself over time. The UCLA Library built and deployed a Drupal module that allows UCLA faculty members to acquire an ORCID, and to link it to the university ID. The link between those two identifiers will simplify registering publications and the CDL Open Access repository, and provide a list of publications for career advancement in a new campusfFaculty information system called Opus.

After a brief contextual overview, this talk will focus on the ORCID.ORG API calls and the OAuth implementation in Drupal.</p>
