title: Getty Research Portal Reboot&#58; Angular and Elasticsearch for Metadata Search Aggregation
slides: '/slides/getty_GRP_Reboot.pptx'
---
<p>As part of the continuous evolution of library search tools, the time for a revamp of the Getty Research Portal, an aggregated search index of digitized art history books across major art institutions, had arrived.

Drawing from the original application, written primarily with Java and Solr, we have reconstructed the Getty Research Portal 2.0 as an Angular application with an Elasticsearch server.  By harnessing the power of Angular for a seamlessly responsive front end and Elasticsearch to provide a schema-less search engine, we have given the Portal refined search capabilities and drastically improved maintainability. We will walk through the benefits and challenges of building an application with these technologies and give the Code4Lib community a high-level understanding of metadata aggregation for libraries the Angular and Elasticsearch way.</p>
