        <h2>Code4Lib is a vibrant and diverse community.</h2>
        <p>We are developers and technologists for libraries,
museums, and archives who have a strong
commitment to open technologies.
Code4Lib began as a simple mailing list in
2003 and held its first face-to-face
meeting in 2005 in Chicago. The first
official annual conference was held in
2006 in Corvallis, Oregon. Code4Lib is
dedicated to being a diverse and inclusive
community of technologists seeking to
share ideas and build collaboration.</p>

        <h2>Code4Lib 2014 Conference</h2>
        <p>The Code4Lib 2014 conference, held at the Sheraton Philadelphia Society Hill from March 7-10,
presents an opportunity for all of us to show
their support for open and collaborative
solutions for higher education, libraries,
museums, and archives through attending
the conference and providing financial
sponsorship. Each year, the Code4Lib
conference helps revitalize the community
as participants meet in person to discuss
new and ongoing projects in a single-track
format with 20-minute presentations and
5-minute lightning talks. Volunteer-led
pre-conference programs provide in-depth
participatory learning experiences for
participants while ad-hoc afternoon
breakout sessions focus on collaboration
around specific topics of interest.</p>
