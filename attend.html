                  <h3>Childcare</h3>
                  <p>
                  Childcare is offered Monday - Thursday at a highly subsidized rate of $10/day, thanks to a generous sponsorship by Equinox and CurateCamp. 
                  Details about Childcare are <a href="/childcare.html">available on the conference website</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The registration link will be posted on the website, and will be emailed to the Code4Lib and Code4LibCon listservs.  There will be no waitlist at this time, but there will be a second release of spots on a TBD future date.
                </p>

                <h3>Additional Information</h3>
                <ol>
                  <li>There will be <strong>two opportunities to register</strong>. 12/10/15 is the
first, where we will be making available 290 spots. Once we have determined
that all required attendees have registered (sponsors, presenters, workshop
leaders), we will reopen registration again in early January for the
remaining spots. The total capacity is 440.</li>

<li>The registration system maintains a two hour session per registration
attempt. Due to the potential of heavy access and this prolonged session,
the conference may appear to sell out quickly. But once early failed
sessions expire, more spots may open up beginning around 2pm. Because of
this we ask you not to assume it is sold out until you hear an announcement
from the planning committee.</li>

<li>There will be no waiting list at this time. A waiting list will open
when we release the second round of registration slots.</li>

<li>The conference program is not complete at this time. See <a href="http://2016.code4lib.org/talks/">the election
results</a> to get an idea of what will be part of the program. This list
represents the presentation voting results. Only the top ten (highlighted)
have been accepted so far. As in recent years, the remainder of the program
will be curated by the program committee, taking into account voting
results, topic diversity, and speaker diversity. These selections will be
announced in coming weeks.</li>

<li>Registration will include the option to select preconference workshops.
You can view <a href="http://2016.code4lib.org/workshops">the available workshops beforehand</a> to get an
idea of what will be offered. Wait lists will be available for
workshops, and you will receive relevant instructions with your
confirmation email.</li>
