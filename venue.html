            <p>The 2016 conference will be held from March 7 through March 10 in the Old City District of Philadelphia.  This location puts conference attendees within easy walking distance of many of Philadelphia’s historical treasures, including Independence Hall, the Liberty Bell, the Constitution Center, and the house where Thomas Jefferson drafted the Declaration of Independence. Attendees will also be a very short distance from the Delaware River waterfront and will be a short walk from numerous excellent restaurants.</p>

            <p>As we’ll be reserving almost all of the space within the hotel for our conference (both rooms and conference spaces), Code4Lib 2016 will have the tight-knit community feel we know is important.</p>
