These new tools also increase the level of reproducibility and provenance in their research, improving the level of transparency and reproducibility.

                    The Knitr package allows researchers to write manuscripts in R and embed all their analysis code directly into their R script. This reduces the number of documents created, increases transparency, and also allows the authors to easily update and change their figures and tables. Knitr can use both Markdown and LaTeX to create PDF and HTML documents.

                    R Shiny is a tool that allows authors to publish their work on as interactive web pages using a simple DSL that requires minimal knowledge of HTML, CSS, Javascript and other standard web technology.

                    In this workshop, I will introduce attendees to these tools. We will learn how to use these two tools using simple, straightforward, examples.  We will create documents using Knitr. We will also briefly explore using Pandoc to convert between different common publishing formats. We will then us R Shiny to publish interactive analyses to the web. We will also discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the tools. At the end of the workshop, librarians will have enough knowledge to continue exploring on their own, use the tools for their own research and to introduce research faculty to these tools.

                    While some knowledge of the R language would be helpful, it is not required. Brief tutorials will be provided prior to the workshop to get attendees get prepared. The focus will be on using simple straightforward examples to illustrate the Knitr and Shiny tools. Guidance and canned routines will be provided where necessary. Likewise, knowledge of Markdown and/or LaTeX would be helpful, but not required.

We wish to create a space to talk about how coding for archives may be different than coding for libraries and interaction with cross-domain tools such as repositories, discovery and access systems.

                    Code4Arc is a participatory event and the agenda will be made available in advance for participants to sign up for lightening talks, demonstrations or case studies. We will also have break-out sessions to discuss topics of interest to the participants, for example, workflows, tool integrations, handoffs and metadata conventions.  Short community project updates will be available from BitCurator Access, Educopia, Archivematica, ArchivesSpace, AtoM and Islandora.</p><p></p><h4>Proposed by: Sarah Romkey</h4><h4>All day</h4></div></div></div><a id="Buzzword-compliant-Logging"></a><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h4 class="panel-title">Buzzword compliant Logging</h4></div><div class="panel-body" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="Buzzword-compliant-LoggingHeader"><div class="panel-body"><p>The preconference will cover real and imaginary world use cases on logging.

Since failure is an inescapable part of our professional work, it's important to be familiar with it, to acknowledge it, and to grow from it -- and, in contravention to longstanding tradition, to accept it as a fact of development life. At Fail4Lib, we'll talk about our own experiences with projects gone wrong, explore some famous design failures in the real world, and talk about how we can come to terms with the reality of failure, to make it part of our creative process -- rather than something to be shunned. Let's train ourselves to understand and embrace failure, encourage enlightened risk-taking, and seek out opportunities to fail and learn. This way, when we do what we do -- and fail at what we do -- we'll do so with grace and without fear.</p><p></p><h4>Proposed by: Andreas Orphanides</h4><h4>Half day, no preference for time</h4></div></div></div><a id="Command-Line-Bootcamp"></a><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h4 class="panel-title">Command Line Bootcamp</h4></div><div class="panel-body" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="Command-Line-BootcampHeader"><div class="panel-body"><p>Come and learn how the command line is the best friend you've always wanted.

While it is suitable for most search tasks, its most common use case is as a front-end for an ILS, and it includes integration with most common systems. Ingest tools are included for dealing with MARC records, OAI-PMH servers and website sitemaps; working with other types of content is simple thanks to Solr’s simple API.

                    VuFind is built with easy configuration and extensibility in mind. Many common needs can be met simply through configuration and a bit of theming, and more advanced customizations may be cleanly achieved with the help of Zend Framework 2’s architecture, which makes building plugins and overriding core services straightforward. The default theme uses Bootstrap to provide a responsive interface, but custom mobile-specific themes may also be deployed.

                    This workshop will offer an overview of VuFind’s features and architecture, assist you in installing a local instance of the software, and run through some common customization steps. The lead development team will be on hand for Q&amp;A. Bring your questions, ideas and access to a laptop or server (preferably running Linux).

Using the EBSCO Discovery Service (EDS) API, the workshop will look at ways of creating a quality discovery experience for users.  The API provides not only a search endpoint for your libraries entire collection, but a number of other killer features that really shape the user experience as well: the Research Starters API for finding topic overviews and the Publications Finder API for finding journal titles and links to full-text, to name a few.

                    With recent infrastructure improvements to increase speed and stability, come get a jumpstart on using the EDS API for your own projects.
                    This workshop will cover, amongst other things:

                    • Integrating discovery within VuFind / Blacklight – how to install and active the discovery API
                    • Integrating reading lists within the learning management system – how to use and activate discovery within the LMS such as Moodle
                    • A primer in authenticating and issuing RESTful calls to the API, including best practices and using our action-oriented, state-aware syntax
                    •Together we'll build a simple application that matches today's current topics (acquired using the New York Times API) with various library materials using the API

Put these all together in a multi-threaded environment to make some fantastic music!  Sonic Pi is a wonderful environment that can be used to teach programming to 10 year olds, but powerful enough to be used for performances at a nightclub.

                    Sonic Pi has a real benefit for teaching programming to kids and adults in a low cost environment.  Music is fun and accessible to a wide audience.

How can you make something useful, easy to use, and enjoyable? How do you know if your target audience is having a good or bad experience?

                    We’ll cover the fundamentals of UX, why it matters, and ways to convince others in your organization to invest in this process. We’ll detail a typical UX journey and common methodologies that are useful for museum professionals, from user research and analysis to rapid prototyping and testing—including lean UX techniques you can use with limited time and money. In addition to practicing hands-on skills as a group through a series of practical activities, we’ll provide you with recommendations for books, articles, and other resources to explore further.

                    You don’t have to be a developer or a designer to integrate UX research and design into your practice. After this session, you’ll be able to answer the following questions:

                    What is user experience? Why does it matter?
                    How do I convince others to adopt this process?
                    What is user research? How do I conduct in-person interviews with my museum patrons to learn about their goals and objectives? How do I use this information effectively?
                    What are some common techniques for evaluating digital content? How can I use activities like card sorting and content inventories to understand our content?
                    How can we produce quick prototypes (analog and digital) to use in user testing? What services and tools exist?
                    What is user testing, and how can we conduct low-cost evaluations with our patrons? How can we use our existing analytics to inform what we test?</p><p></p><h4>Proposed by: Michael Tedeschi</h4><h4>Half day, no preference for time</h4></div></div></div><a id="Repositories-in-Production"></a><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h4 class="panel-title">Repositories in Production</h4></div><div class="panel-body" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="Repositories-in-ProductionHeader"><div class="panel-body"><p>This workshop will be a discussion around topics and techniques to consider while transitioning a project into a production service.

Mapping the language of specialized content with user’s vernacular is tough. For example, maybe you’re trying to help a 19 year old college students search the writings of a sharp-witted, revolutionary era Philadelphia gentleman? Or you might be helping budding legal students hunt through hundreds of years of arcane legal precedent? Or gastroenterologists hunt through their favorite medical journals? Young children through dinosaur articles?

                    In this half-day course, you’ll use Elasticsearch to build a basic semantic search application. We’ll start by bringing the core search internals down to earth. Using Python and machine learning libraries, you’ll teach the search engine to learn the vernacular for your domain (Darth Vader ~ Anakin Skywalker; “The Master” ~ “Sherlock Holmes”). You’ll see how to integrate and curate these smarts back into the search engine to improve the relevance of your applications. You’ll come out of this workshop armed with some specific techniques that you can apply to your own search problems.</p><p></p><h4>Proposed by: Doug Turnbull</h4><h4>Half day, no preference for time</h4></div></div></div><a id="Measuring-Your-Metadata"></a><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h4 class="panel-title">Measuring Your Metadata</h4></div><div class="panel-body" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="Measuring-Your-MetadataHeader"><div class="panel-body"><p>Tools and standards abound for creating and enriching metadata, but measuring, monitoring, and managing metadata for the long haul can be a daunting task. What tools are out there to assess the shape of our metadata? How can visualizations show us the gaps or flaws in our description? What can web traffic analytics tell us about the value of our metadata? What is quality, really? We certainly don’t have all the answers, but together we can workshop the questions. Specific topics will be driven by the interest of attendees. The organizers will bring examples of their own work at NYPL in visualization, data analysis with Python, and Google analytics assessment and invite participants to bring their own tools and strategies to share in group discussion, short demos, and hands-on breakout sessions. Takeaways will include: exposure to approaches and tools in use in the field and an expanded network of commiserators to help you through your next metadata audit.</p><p></p><h4>Proposed by: Shawn Averkamp</h4><h4>Half day, no preference for time</h4></div></div></div><a id="Getting-More-out-of-Your-Maps-Georeferencing-and-Optimizing-Digitized-Maps-for-Use-in-Web-Applications"></a><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h4 class="panel-title">Getting More out of Your Maps: Georeferencing and Optimizing Digitized Maps for Use in Web Applications</h4></div><div class="panel-body" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="Getting-More-out-of-Your-Maps-Georeferencing-and-Optimizing-Digitized-Maps-for-Use-in-Web-ApplicationsHeader"><div class="panel-body"><p>Being able to interact with historical maps in their proper geographic space allows for more accurate study of the changes a location has undergone over time. This session will walk through the process of transforming a digitized historical map into a georeferenced image. From there, it can be overlayed on a modern map for use in interactive web applications or to extract features and create new geospatial data. We will cover how to georeference a map, as well as options and file formats for saving these unique image formats. We will also cover processing of these images with the open-source Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) tools to optimize them for display at multiple zoom levels. We will then discuss using the open-source tool Geoserver to store and deliver these maps online for use in web applications using Leaflet, OpenLayers or viewing in platforms like Google Earth. Finally, we will share a script we have compiled that automates many of these processes, which saves a good deal of time when processing large map collections.</p><p></p><h4>Proposed by: Megan Slemons</h4><h4>Half day, no preference for time</h4></div></div></div><a id="Islandora-for-Managers"></a><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h4 class="panel-title">Islandora for Managers</h4></div><div class="panel-body" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="Islandora-for-ManagersHeader"><div class="panel-body"><p>Islandora is a digital asset management system that provides out­of­the­box repository solutions (Solution Packs) for a wide range of digital collections and research domains.

Which are being discussed and shared? Today, it is not possible for librarians to answer those questions by looking only at Journal Impact Factor™ or at a simple citation count. It is now common to talk about academic research outside the formal literature in places like Facebook, Wikipedia, and beyond in bookmarks, comments, social shares, and links to other research entities.  To facilitate getting to the answers, Crossref, the non-profit membership organization working to make scholarly content easy to find, cite, link, and assess, will introduce a freely available tool (coming in spring 2016) for the use of all stakeholders.  The new DET (DOI Event Tracker) will monitor and quantify the reach and frequency of discussion around scholarly works by tracking activity from potentially any web source where an event is associated with a DOI (Digital Object Identifier).  Consistent with its not-for-profit mission, Crossref will not commercialize the tool, but will make it available to all libraries, publishers, and third-parties to build upon. In this interactive session, Crossref will explain and demonstrate the new DOI Event Tracker (DET), and take feedback and questions about its functionality and potential applications.  Some features of the DET include:
                    •        Data on event activity across a common pool of online channels
                    •        Cross-publisher monitoring to enable benchmarking and provide context to the data
                    •        CC-0 license for open and flexible propagation of data
                    •        Query-initiated retrieval or real-time alerts when an event of interest occurs
                    •        Common format for normalizing data results across the diverse set of sources via modern REST API
